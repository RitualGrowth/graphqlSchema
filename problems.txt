1- link in the flow attribute in the flowsRun type
2- same type (ProjectFlowStageStats)
3- i think the second type of ProjectFlowStageStats may have an enum for the stage types
4- in the TotalUsersInfo type i think we need to use int instead of floats in the attributes
5- redundancy of the stage infos and types we need more optimization in all stage types
6- in StageInfo type we have recursive call/type of StageInfo
7- I think overallStatusInfo have problems with redundant attributes in other types
8- two redundant type of cohortInfo 
9- DurationInfo and DateTimeInfo Redundancy
10- Enum Values Naming Conventions
11- UserCompletionInfo and TotalUsersInfo Similar Fields
12- Redundant Types for Similar Data Structures(Multiple types like cohortFlowStats and cohortStageStats contain overlapping data structures)
